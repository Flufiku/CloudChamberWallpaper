# Cloudchamber Wallpaper
A live android wallpaper of a cloud chamber.

I decided to use the [Processing Language](https://android.processing.org) for creating the wallpaper. Since I was not very familiar with Processing, I decided to create a proof of concept in python and port it over.

This was supposed to be a Slime Wallpaper inspired by [a video by Sebastian Lague](#credit), but I could not get it to run smoothly on a phone, so I decided to pivot to making a live background of a cloud chamber simulation, since the slime reminded me of this.
