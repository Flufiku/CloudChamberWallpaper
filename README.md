# SlimeWallpaper
A live android wallpaper of some moving slime, based on [a video by Sebastian Lague](#credit).

I decided to use the [Processing Language](https://android.processing.org) for creating the wallpaper. Since I was not very familiar with Processing, I decided to create a proof of concept in python and port it over.
